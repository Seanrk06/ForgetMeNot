Steps to setup website

1. Cd into root with the terminal
2. Make sure you have node.js installed and type "node index.js"
3. Type into your chrome search bar "http://localhost:3500" this will take you to the home page
4. Use the navigation bar it should get you to where you want (the student version of the dashboard is not linked if you want to get to it click Dashboard then go to the search bar and change "http://localhost:3500/teacher" to "http://localhost:3500/student")
5. If you plan to screw with the server a lot I recomend using "https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon" as it will automatically update the server every time you make changes otherwise every time you make changes you need to press "ctrl + c" to stop the server then retype "node index.js"
